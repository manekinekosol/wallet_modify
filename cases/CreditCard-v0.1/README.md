Credit Card V0.1
================

This is a very early prototype, and my first time using [SketchUp](http://www.sketchup.com).

This is the version seen in the [demo video](https://firefly.city/#demo).

A newer Credit Card V1 will be out soon:

- Shorter wire distances and easier wire routing
- Power switch

However, for a quick and simple case you can use **today**, so you can work
on the Firefly from a coffee shop, this is what we use.
