Cases
=====

Here is a list of cases.

We welcome any interesting additions; they do not need to be 3D printed; a How-To on
building a Firefly into an Altoids tin or other clever ideas are just as awesome.

Credit Card v0.1
----------------

This is the case used for the prototype in our [demo viedo](https://firefly.city/#demo).

It has several problems, which we are addressing in a new revision:

- No power switch
- Overly complicated routing of wires

If you are impatient, feel free to try it out. Otherwise, we highly recommend you wait
for the next version.


Credit Card v0.2
----------------

The changes we are working on:

- Orienting the Arduino Nano to be vertical to minimize wiring distances
- Adding a power slider/spinner
- Likely stacking the batteries

Coming soon.
