Firefly Wallet
==============

Weclome to the Firefly DIY Air-gapped Hardware Wallet project.

There are still a few things we are working on, but we wanted to start
getting some files into the hands of eager developers.

Also, if you haven't seen it already, please check out our
[crowdsale](https://ethers.io/#!/app-link/contribute.firefly.city). By contributing
to the project, you get your very own yourNameHere.firefly.eth ENS name on the
Ethereum network and you help fund development of the Firefly.

### Cases

Currently limited to 3D printable cases, but we would love to have other
creative people out there contribute interesting designs.

A better 3D printable case will be published soon, but for the impatient,
the prototype case is available.


### Diagrams

Images and source files used to build documentation. Currently we have a circuit schematic
and a breadboard layout for prototyping.


### Source

The Arduino sketch and required (modified) libraries.


Future
------

- Better 3D printed case; still being designed, but easier to wire (soonish)
- Printed Circuit Board (PCB) layout for more advanced, but tinier devices (future)
